                        /* December 24, 2022 JOKRCANTSPELL Esports Comms
                        <br />
                        Today we are excited to announce that the second international
                        event of the VALORANT Champions Tour 2023 will be taking place in
                        Japan! As part of our goal to bring our sport to new audiences
                        around the world, there is no better place for us to present one
                        of VCT 2023's biggest events. Over the past twelve months, the
                        VALORANT community in Japan has grown rapidly with fandom presence
                        across multiple events. Our team is working together to build new
                        experiences that will excite fans around the world and we can't
                        wait to announce what's in store. The Masters will take place in
                        June, after the inaugural International League split-end. The
                        Masters will feature the top ten teams from each of the three
                        leagues, giving an additional slot to the region that won the
                        LOCK//IN event in Brazil. It will also be an important opportunity
                        for the best performing teams to solidify their qualification for
                        the Champions. After the Masters, teams will have one last chance
                        to qualify for the Champions via the Last Chance Qualifier which
                        will take place this summer.

                        <br />
                        Earlier this year, we implemented Automatic Smurf Detection to
                        adjust the MMR of smurf accounts. This experiment was successful,
                        and resulted in a significant reduction in the number of matches
                        in which a smurf was involved that resulted in a stomp.
                        Additionally, changes to the group five limit have led to a
                        notable reduction in smurf activity, which has also resulted in
                        increased match fairness over the same period. Group of five
                        matchmaking continues to be the fairest type of matchmaking in
                        VALORANT. Overall, the number of smurfs is down ~17% compared to
                        the start of the year, and newly created smurfs are getting the
                        "correct" MMR 2-3 times faster...

                    Minecraft Legends is an upcoming action-strategy video game
                    developed by Mojang Studios and Blackbird Interactive and published
                    by Xbox Game Studios. It is set to be released for Nintendo Switch,
                    PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows
                    in the first half of 2023. It is a spin-off of Minecraft. With a new
                    upcoming plot where Minecraft Legends takes place in the Minecraft
                    universe during an invasion by the piglins from the Nether. As the
                    Nether spreads its corruption across the Overworld, a great hero

                    neither fact nor fiction in the Minecraft universe, but rather take
                    place in a tale that has been passed down through generations.

                    For over a decade after the release Half-Life 2: Episode Two in
                    October 2007, there was very little news from Valve on the next
                    Half-Life game. Half-Life 2: Episode Three, the third and final
                    installment of the Half-Life 2 episodes, was expected to follow soon
                    after Episode Two, as Valve had stated that they aimed to release a
                    new episode every six to eight months. However, as of December 2022,
                    three pieces of concept art are all Valve have shown of the sequel.
                    Since then, Valve has released ten other games. On November 18,
                    2019, 12 years after the release of Half-Life 2: Episode Two and the
                    day before the 21st anniversary of the release of the original
                    Half-Life, Valve announced Half-Life: Alyx, a virtual reality video
                    game set in the Half-Life universe, where you play as Alyx Vance in
                    the aftermath of the Combine invasion on earth, before the events of
                    Half-Life 2. On November 21 the first trailer for the game was
                    released and the game became available for pre-purchase. According
                    to lead programmer David Speyrer, in an interview with the video
                    game magazine The Verge released the same day, Half-Life: Alyx is
                    "the next part of the Half-Life story," and says that they recommend
                    playing through Half-Life 2: Episode Two beforehand.

                <p>
                    Starfield is an upcoming action role-playing video game developed by
                    Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game
                    was announced during Bethesda's E3 Press Conference in 2018. The
                    game is set in a space-themed world, and will be the first new
                    intellectual property developed by Bethesda in over twenty-five
                    years. Starfield is set in an area that extends outward from the
                    Solar System for approximately 50 light-years called The Settled
                    Systems. Around the year 2310, the two largest factions in the game,
                    the United Colonies and Freestar Collective, engaged in a conflict
                    called the Colony War. The game takes place 20 years after the war,
                    with the major factions enjoying an uneasy peace. The player assumes
                    the role of a customizable character who is a member of
                    Constellation, an organization of space explorers. The game can be
                    played in either first- or third-person perspectives.
